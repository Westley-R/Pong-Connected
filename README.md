## Setup
This project is honestly fairly simple to setup.
- Open the project folder in a terminal
- `python -m venv .venv`
- Activate the venv (I believe it's `source ./.venv/Scripts/activate` on Linux, honestly, I use VSCode to handle it automatically)
- `pip install pygame numpy` (if it gives you grief about the versions, pygame is 2.6.1 and numpy is 2.3.1)

## Running the project
Super simple, just run `main.py` like any other python program, just make sure the venv is still active. (`python main.py`)

This file acts as my development log; I got the idea to do this from [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)'s Highway to Hardware, which requires you to log your progress throughout a [project](https://github.com/Westley-R/Spooky-1-Open-Wood-CNC/tree/main).
